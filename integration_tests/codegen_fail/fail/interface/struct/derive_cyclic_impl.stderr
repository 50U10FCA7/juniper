   = note: ...which again requires expanding type alias `Node1Value`, completing the cycle
   = note: type aliases cannot be recursive
   = help: consider using a struct, enum, or union instead to break the cycle
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types.html#recursive-types> for more information
note: cycle used when collecting item types in top-level module
